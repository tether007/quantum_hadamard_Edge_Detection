<h1> Classical Approach </h1>
<p>
    Classical edge detection of images are done by methods/algo such as Sobel operator, Laplacian based Methods as these are FirstODE
    Sobel Operator uses 3X3 convolutional kernel to calculating gradients in the hori and verti directions
    </br>
    the wildly used algorithm is Canny edge detector

<h2> Quantum approach </h2>

<h3>But why is Quantum approach better ?</h3>
    </br>
    <li>
        <ul>leverage the principles of quantum computing, such as superposition and entanglement, to process image data more efficiently than classical methods</ul>
        <ul>QPIE(Quantum Probability image encoding)</ul>
        <ul>These algorithms aim to detect the boundaries and features within images by exploiting quantum parallelism, which allows for the simultaneous processing of multiple pixel neighborhoods</ul>
        <ul>A foundational approach involves encoding image pixel information into quantum states, where pixel positions are represented by computational basis states and pixel values are encoded as probability amplitudes</ul>
        <ul>One of the earliest and most notable quantum edge detection algorithms is the Quantum Hadamard Edge Detection (QHED) algorithm, which can detect edges with only a single-qubit Hadamard gate, independent of the image size, resulting in a constant time complexity of O(1) compared to the classical O(2n) complexity</ul>
